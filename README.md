# CNN Hardware Accelerator

This project aims to design and implement a hardware accelerator for Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) targeting efficient and high-performance inference on FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) platforms. The accelerator is optimized to accelerate the computation-intensive operations involved in CNNs, such as convolution, pooling, and activation functions.

## Features

- Accelerated convolution, pooling, and activation functions.
- Optimized for efficient memory access and utilization.
- Support for various CNN architectures and layer types.
- Flexible design for easy integration into different FPGA platforms.
- Performance benchmarks and comparison with software implementations.
